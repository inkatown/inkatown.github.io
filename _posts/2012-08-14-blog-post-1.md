**Artificial Intelligence in the Andean Region: A View from the Latin American Artificial Intelligence Index (ILIA)**

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a transformative force worldwide, and the Andean region is no exception. To understand the current state of AI in this region, it is useful to begin by analyzing indicators that measure the progress and adoption of these technologies. One of the most prominent benchmarks in this field is the Latin American Artificial Intelligence Index (ILIA), a report that offers a detailed overview of AI development in Latin America. This index, inspired by Stanford University's AI Index, has become an invaluable tool for assessing how countries in the region are advancing in this area.

According to the ILIA, Chile is emerging as the undisputed leader in artificial intelligence in Latin America, surpassing even countries with larger economies, such as Brazil. This leadership is no coincidence; Chile has implemented public policies and national strategies that foster technological innovation, AI research, and the training of specialized talent. Furthermore, the country has managed to attract foreign investment in the technology sector, which has strengthened its ecosystem of startups and companies dedicated to developing AI-based solutions.

But what does this leadership mean in the context of the Andean region? To answer this question, it is necessary to explore not only technological advances but also the impact that AI is having on people's daily lives. Today, tools like ChatGPT have become ubiquitous, helping students complete school or university assignments, facilitating text writing, and even enabling conversations through applications like WhatsApp. However, beyond its practical use, it is essential to understand how this technology works and what implications it has for the region.

### AI as a magical "black box"

For many, artificial intelligence remains a kind of magical "black box" that produces amazing results, but whose inner workings remain unknown. In the English-speaking world, terms like "hallucination" and "dreaming" are used to describe phenomena in which AI models generate responses that, while coherent, may lack a basis in reality. This phenomenon, known as "AI hallucination," is a reminder that, despite its advances, technology still has limitations.

At the heart of these tools are artificial neural networks, a type of computational model inspired by the functioning of the human brain. Transformers, a specific neural network architecture, are responsible for recent advances in natural language processing. The "T" in ChatGPT, for example, refers to this technology, which allows AI to efficiently understand and generate text. Thanks to transformers, tasks that once seemed impossible for computers, such as machine translation or the generation of coherent text, are now a reality.

### The Cost of Artificial Intelligence

However, the development and implementation of AI are not without challenges. One of the most critical aspects is the cost associated with the infrastructure needed to train and operate these models. Graphics processing units (GPUs), essential for training neural networks, are extremely expensive and consume large amounts of energy. This technological requirement has created a significant gap between large technology companies, which have the resources to invest in this infrastructure, and smaller players, who face considerable barriers to entry.

Furthermore, the energy consumption of AI is an issue that cannot be ignored. A few years ago, it was estimated that a simple Google search consumed enough energy to keep a light bulb lit for a given period. In comparison, training an AI model requires an exponentially greater amount of energy. This high consumption not only has economic implications but also environmental ones, as the heat generated by the servers must be dissipated through cooling systems, which in turn require large amounts of water.

### The Andean Region Facing the Challenges of AI

In the Andean region, the challenges of artificial intelligence (AI) vary by country. Chile leads in adoption and development, while others face a lack of infrastructure, talent, and resources. However, this does not mean the region is lagging; there are opportunities to use AI strategically and sustainably.
The Latin American AI Index (ILIA) focuses on sectors such as banking, but does not reflect their specific needs.
