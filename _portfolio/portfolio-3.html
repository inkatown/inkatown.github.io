How This Python Code Works

This project uses several tools to automatically create a knowledge graph from text:

    AI Assistant (OpenAI): The code uses a smart AI (ChatOpenAI) to read text and identify the important concepts and relationships.

    Graph Transformer: A special tool (LLMGraphTransformer) takes the AI's understanding and turns it into a structured knowledge graph with nodes (the important things) and edges (how they're connected).

    Visualization (PyVis): The Network tool from PyVis creates an interactive web page where you can see and explore the knowledge graph.

    Environment Setup: The dotenv and os tools help manage your OpenAI API key securely.
