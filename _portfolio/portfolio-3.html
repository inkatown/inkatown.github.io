How This Python Code Works
This project automates the creation of a knowledge graph from text using a few key components:

AI Assistant (OpenAI): An intelligent model, specifically ChatOpenAI, reads and processes the input text to identify key concepts and the relationships between them.

Graph Transformer: The LLMGraphTransformer takes the information extracted by the AI and structures it into a knowledge graph, complete with nodes (the concepts) and edges (the relationships).

Visualization (PyVis): Using the Network tool from PyVis, the project generates an interactive web page that allows you to visually explore the created knowledge graph.

Environment Setup: The dotenv and os libraries handle the secure management of your OpenAI API key, ensuring it isn't exposed in the code.
