What I Do
======

I am a computer scientist, AI policy advocate, and folk artist dedicated to bridging technology, equity, and culture. With a PhD in Computer Science and expertise in text mining, topic modeling, and machine learning, I develop data-driven solutions to support social and medical decision-making. My work focuses on AI governance, fairness, and transparency, ensuring that AI systems are ethical, inclusive, and beneficial for all.

As a Science and Technology Fellow at the National Science Foundation (NSF), I led initiatives to standardize data documentation, integrate AI-powered tools, and improve decision-making processes. I actively contribute to AI policy working groups, collaborating with federal agencies to address data governance, ethical AI practices, and workforce development.

Beyond technology, I am passionate about preserving and sharing Andean culture through music and art. My journey as a first-generation American of indigenous descent fuels my commitment to advocating for underserved communities and ensuring equitable access to AI’s benefits.

Through research, advocacy, and storytelling, I strive to create a future where technology and culture intersect to drive innovation, equity, and inclusion. Let’s build a better world—together.



Professional Biography
------
Jose Hurtado, PhD, is a computer scientist, machine learning consultant, lecturer, musician, advocate, and researcher who has focused on text mining and topic modeling during his Ph.D. studies. He proposed using these methods to discover knowledge from various sources and support social and medical decisions. During his executive fellowship at the National Science Foundation (NSF), he was instrumental in standardizing data documentation and establishing transparent information stream relationships to integrate GRFP application data into the NSF document search tool. This initiative enabled document clustering and topic discovery, facilitating more efficient analysis. Given that much of the collected data from applicants is in text format, these tools aid in application evaluation and longitudinal analysis, empowering program directors to run reports themselves.  

Additionally, Jose actively engaged in AI policy working groups, such as the Artificial Intelligence Community of Practice and the Enterprise Data Inventory Open Data Subgroup Meeting, where he contributed to discussions on best practices and policy formulation in AI. He also participated in the Artificial Intelligence R&D Inter-agency Working Group, collaborating with other agencies to address crucial topics like data governance and AI policy formulation. Within his office, he provided an executive summary of a machine-learning strategy for university admissions and acted as a liaison for AI-related topics.  

Jose is frequently called upon for his expertise to explain AI issues in layperson's terms within his office. Recognizing the importance of his platform as a scientist, he constantly seeks out AI practitioners and ethicists with well-established principles of responsible AI practices. This led him to interview Dr. Ravit Dotan, a renowned AI ethicist, on the *Sci on the Fly* podcast.  

As a first-generation American of indigenous Andean descent, Jose’s journey from working as a janitor, trash collection laborer, and landfill worker has provided him with a unique understanding of the needs of underserved communities. This personal experience, coupled with his academic and professional background, drives his passion for addressing the impact of AI on the workforce, including job displacement, skills training, and the creation of new employment opportunities. He believes that by designing policies to increase the pool of AI workforce, the U.S. can stay at the forefront of AI innovation and improve opportunities for all.  

Jose’s multifaceted background as a scientist, Andean artist, and advocate enables him to approach AI governance with a holistic perspective, ensuring that policies are equitable, transparent, and inclusive. His work reflects a commitment to bridging technology, policy, and culture to create a future where AI serves the collective good.
